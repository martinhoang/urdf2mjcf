# Development Roadmap - urdf2mjcf

This document tracks the development progress and future plans for the urdf2mjcf project.

---

## Current Release & Next Steps

### v0.8.0 - Planned (Next Release) ðŸŽ¯
- [x] Processing multiple meshes (with their colors) inside a DAE file
- [x] Auto detect and validate mesh face count before conversion
- [ ] Save JSON file with relative package path if relative paths were given at original CLI / config JSON file
- [ ] Passing additional arguments alongside JSON config file
- [ ] Add logging system with different verbosity levels
- [ ] Re-arrange post-processing procedures for max functionalities and avoid potential bugs

---

## Future Vision (After v0.8.0)

### Potential Features for Later Releases
- Unit tests for the whole package
- GUI interface for conversion configuration
- Real-time conversion progress display
- Automatic URDF validation before conversion

---

## Completed Releases

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- DAE files with multiple meshes/colors not fully supported
- Some URDF transmission types not converted
- Limited support for complex joint constraints
- No GUI interface yet

### Performance Considerations
- Large meshes (>1M faces) may be slow to process
- Parallel processing limited by CPU cores
- Memory usage scales with mesh complexity

### Compatibility Notes
- Requires Python 3.8+
- CoACD requires additional dependencies
- Some features require pymeshlab
